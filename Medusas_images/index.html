        <p>Only once a year, on his birthday, did Charlie Bucket ever get to taste a bit of
            chocolate. The whole family saved up their money for that special occasion, and
            when the great day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small chocolate
            bar to eat all by himself. And each time he received it, on those marvellous birthday
            mornings, he would place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and
            treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for the next few days, he would
            allow himself only to look at it, but never to touch it. Then at last, when he could
            stand it no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper wrapping at one corner
            to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and then he would take a tiny nibble â€” just enough
            to allow the lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue. The next day, he
            would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and so on. And in this way, Charlie
            would make his sixpenny bar of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.</p>
